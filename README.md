# NeighborhoodWatch

Smart Device that watches your streets.  Uses deep learning object detection models to capture speeding vehicles along with licence plate information and associated metadata. Can help you build a database of repeat offenders in hopes of being a deterrant.  
Similar to your smart doorbell, this device is meant to monitor your streets.  Can be reconfigured to detect different objects depending on application.  The main idea 

__Problem__

My sister's street is a nice straight line thats very crowded but unfortunately is often used as a drag strip.  Despite speed bumps and numerous complaints to the city, the speeding is still very persistant.  The goal is to make a device that can record the speeding cars and build a database of neighborhood speeders.  We can use modern computer vision models to achieve this goal and deploy it on an edge device.  


__Pipeline and Features__

We will configure and train the model locally or in google colab.  Then we will convert the model into a format optimized for deployment on the Jetson Nano.
